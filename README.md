# Overview

The program we wrote is a web app using ReactJS for inventory management. The products are uploaded by an admin and then are displayed in the dashboard. Future featuress include the ability to edit and delete data from the dashboard. The data is stored in a central cloud database (firebase).

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- Git / GitHub
- Cloud Store
- React-icons
- ReactJS
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Cloud Firestore is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database that your Apple, Android, and web apps can access directly via native SDKs. Cloud Firestore is also available in native Node.js, Java, Python, Unity, C++ and Go SDKs, in addition to REST and RPC APIs.

React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. Itâ€™s used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

React-icons is a small library that helps you add icons (from all different icon libraries) to your React apps. It delivers the icons to your app as components so they're easier to work with, and it lets you style them so they're consistent with the overall style of your app.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages.
JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.

HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
